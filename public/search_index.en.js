and Borrowing in Rust\nIntroduction\nRust is a very unique programming language. It gives you low-level control over your code and the ability to manage \nmemory without allocating it or de-allocating it with specific commands (although that is also possible with the \nunsafe\nkeyword). One of the ways that Rust can guarantee memory safety without a garbage collector is by implementing the \nconcepts of ownership and borrowing into the language.\n\n\nWhat is Ownership?\nOwnership is the way that Rust manages memory. It is a set of rules that the compiler says must be followed in for your \ncode to compile.\nThe very basic ownership rules in Rust are:\n\nEvery value is assigned to a variable, and that variable is the value's owner.\nEvery value can only have ONE owner at any given time.\nWhen the owner variable goes out of scope, a special function named drop is called and its value is dropped.\n\nLet's define a couple of those terms mentioned:\nscope refers to the lines in the program where a variable is valid.\ndrop is a function that Rust calls on variables allocated to the heap, that frees up memory for that variable when \nit goes out of scope. \nIn this very basic example, the variable dog_owner is the owner of the String \"dog\":\n{\n    let dog_owner = String::from(\"dog\"); //'let' is the keyword used to declare variables in Rust\n}\n\nWhen the program reached the }, the variable dog_owner goes out of scope and drop is called on it to free the memory \nit had allocated to it.\nIn the next example, the ownership of the String \"dog\" is moved from dog_owner to dog_trainer: \n{\n    let dog_owner = String::from(\"dog\"); //This line creates a String type from the string primitive \"dog\"\n    let dog_trainer = dog_owner;\n}\n\nAt this point, the variable dog_owner is no longer valid. We can verify this by trying to print out the value of \ndog_owner: \n{\n    let dog_owner = String::from(\"dog\");\n    let dog_trainer = dog_owner;\n    println!(\"{}\", dog_owner); //println!() is used to print values to the system output\n}\n\nIn other languages, you would expect that dog would be printed to the console, but in Rust this creates an error:\nerror[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `dog_owner`\n  --&gt; src\\main.rs:14:24\n   |\n12 |         let dog_owner = String::from(\"dog\");\n   |             --------- move occurs because `dog_owner` has type `std::string::String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait\n13 |         let dog_trainer = dog_owner;\n   |                           --------- value moved here\n14 |         println!(\"{}\", dog_owner); //println!() is used to print values to the system output\n   |                        ^^^^^^^^^ value borrowed here after move\n\nerror: aborting due to previous error\n\nIn the console, the error line value borrowed here after move means that we tried to borrow the variable \ndog_owner by passing it into the println!() macro, but it was already moved to dog_trainer so this is not allowed. \nBorrowing will be explained in the next section.\nWhat is Borrowing?\nTo start, let us define what references are: a reference is a variable that refers to another value, but does not \nhave ownership of it. When we pass a reference variable into a function, it is said that the function is borrowing \nthat variable.\nFor example, the function rent_movie() is borrowing a reference to the movie variable:\nfn main(){\n    let movie = String::from(\"Star Wars\");\n    rent_movie(&amp;movie);\n}\n\nfn rent_movie(movie: &amp;String) -&gt; &amp;String{ //Take a String reference as a parameter, and return a String reference\n    String::from(\"rented\") //The String \"rented\" is returned from the function. \n}\n\nSo far, so good. But what if we try to modify the movie in rent_movie()?\nfn main(){\n    let movie = String::from(\"Star Wars\");\n    rent_movie(&amp;movie);\n}\n\nfn rent_movie(movie: &amp;String) -&gt; &amp;String{ //Take a String reference as a parameter, and return a String reference\n    movie.push_str(\": Director's Cut\"); //attempting to create the String \"Star Wars: Director's Cut\"\n    String::from(\"rented\") //return \"rented\" \n}\n\nThis will not compile! As shown in the following error message, references are immutable in Rust:\nerror[E0596]: cannot borrow `*movie` as mutable, as it is behind a `&amp;` reference\n  --&gt; src\\main.rs:34:5\n   |\n33 | fn rent_movie(movie: &amp;String){\n   |                      ------- help: consider changing this to be a mutable reference: `&amp;mut std::string::String`\n34 |     movie.push_str(\": Director's Cut\"); //attempting to create the String \"Star Wars: Director's Cut\"\n   |     ^^^^^ `movie` is a `&amp;` reference, so the data it refers to cannot be borrowed as mutable\n\nerror: aborting due to previous error\n\nThis error illustrates something very important about Rust-- all variable are immutable by default! Typically, you would use a reference variable if you just wanted to read its value and not modify it.\nHowever, this error can be fixed by making movie mutable. That is, make it so that its value can be modified. We can do this by adding the mut \nkeyword to the variable declaration and also make it so that rent_movie() accepts a mutable String as a parameter:\nfn main(){\n    let mut movie = String::from(\"Star Wars\");\n    rent_movie(&amp;mut movie);\n}\n\nfn rent_movie(movie: &amp;mut String) -&gt; &amp;mut String{ //Take a mutable String reference as a parameter, and return a mutable String reference\n    movie.push_str(\": Director's Cut\"); //attempting to create the String \"Star Wars: Director's Cut\"\n    movie //return the String \"Star Wars: Director's Cut\"\n}\nConclusion\nThe main takeaways from this post are: values can be moved to different variables, but can only belong to ONE\nvariable at any given time. If you want to temporarily pass the value of a variable to a function, you can pass a reference \nto that variable to the function, and the function will borrow the variable and then give it back after the function \nreturns. There is a lot more to this topic, but I will leave it there for now!\n\nGet Rusty!\nSee more at the Official Rust documentation\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/ownership-and-borrowing/","title":"Ownership and Borrowing in Rust"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/rocket-web-framework/":{"body":"Building a simple REST API with the Rocket Web Framework\nIntroduction\nRocket is a web framework written in and designed to be used for the Rust programming language. It has many similarities to web frameworks in other languages, like Flask, Rails, Node.js, and others. Rocket makes it easy to create a simple web server application, while keeping the guaranteed memory safety and security of the Rust language. It abstracts some web server details about routing and HTTP away from the user so that you can get an application up and running quickly. In this post, I am going to show you how to create a simple request/response server that you can interact with through your web browser. Let's begin!\nCreate a new Rust project\nFirst, we need to create a new Rust project. The project will be named 'basic-web'. Navigate the directory where you want the project to be and enter the following two commands in your terminal:\ncargo new basic-web --bin\ncd basic-web\n\nNext, add the following dependency to the Cargo.toml file in the root of the project directory:\n[dependencies]\nrocket = \"0.4.4\"\n\nRocket requires the nightly version of Rust, which contains more experimental features, so we are going to set it up so that the nightly version is only used on this specific project. Enter the following command in the terminal to do so:\nrustup override set nightly\n\nOnce Rust nightly finishes installing, we can start writing the web server!\nRoutes and Requests\nRocket accepts requests by matching the route requested by the client application to the request handler with the matching route. In the main.rs file, copy the following code in:\n#[get(\"/hello\")]              // route attribute\nfn world() -&gt; &amp;'static str {  // request handler function\n    \"hello, world!\"\n}\n\nThe line #[get(\"/hello\")] defines a route that will be invoked on any HTTP GET request to http://localhost:8000/hello. It must be that exact URL, or the server will return an HTTP 404 response.\nThe function defined will return \"hello world\" to the client in the response when the request is received.\nTo make the route handler a little more interesting, change it so that it looks like the following:\n#[get(\"/hello/&lt;name&gt;\")]\nfn hello(name: &amp;RawStr) -&gt; String {\n    format!(\"Hello, {}!\", name.as_str())\n}\n\nNow, the route has a dynamic path. The angle brackets in \"/hello/&lt;name&gt;\" mean that any string you place inside of that path on the client will be extracted and passed into the request handler function. In this case, we are displaying the passed in string next to the word \"Hello\". So the response will change based on the URL path! Once the server is running you will be able to see how it works.\nServing a file\nTo make the server more realistic, we are going to add a route handler that will serve an image file from the server, to the client. \nFirst, place any kind of image file into a directory named static. This directory must be at the root of the project.\nNext, add the following function to the main.rs file:\n\nuse rocket::response::NamedFile;\nuse std::path::{PathBuf, Path};\n\n#[get(\"/&lt;file..&gt;\")]\nfn files(file: PathBuf) -&gt; Option&lt;NamedFile&gt; {\n    NamedFile::open(Path::new(\"static/\").join(file)).ok()\n}\n\nThe first two lines are some necessary import statements. The function files will serve a static file hosted in the 'static' folder on the server. The route handler will match any URL at the index of the server, with any file name added on. For example, this URL will serve the file ferris.jpg and display it in the browser: http://localhost:8000/ferris.jpg.\nThe server can now serve text and files, let's get it mounted and running!\nMounting\nThe last thing that needs to happen in order for the web application to function is the request routes need to be mounted to the paths created by Rocket.\nCopy the following code into the main.rs file, replacing the main function that was in there:\nfn main() {\n    rocket::ignite().mount(\"/\", routes![files])\n                    .mount(\"/hello\", routes![world])\n                    .launch();\n}\n\nThis code will create an new instance of Rocket with ignite(), and mount all of the routes in the supplied Vector at the given base path. The Vector is the routes![world] part, which accepts any number of route handling function. We are matching two different routes, the base path of the server at /, and the path at /hello. / will be used to serve the image, and /hello will be used to serve a text response. \nThe launch() function will start the Rocket application server and begin listening for and dispatching requests to the mounted routes.\nFinally, add these lines to the main.rs file:\n#![feature(proc_macro_hygiene, decl_macro)]\nuse rocket::response::NamedFile;\n\n#[macro_use]\nextern crate rocket;\n\nThe #![feature] line tells Rust to use feature from the Nightly version of Rust.\nThe extern crate rocket imports the Rocket crate and all of it's macros that are needed to run the server. \nStarting the server\nNow we can start the server! Start the application by typing cargo run into the terminal, and you should see something similar to this:\n🔧  Configured for development.\n    =&gt; address: localhost\n    =&gt; port: 8000\n    =&gt; log: normal\n    =&gt; workers: [logical cores * 2]\n    =&gt; secret key: generated\n    =&gt; limits: forms = 32KiB\n    =&gt; keep-alive: 5s\n    =&gt; tls: disabled\n🛰  Mounting '/hello':\n    =&gt; GET /hello/world (world)\n🚀  Rocket has launched from http://localhost:8000\n\nYou can now visit http://localhost:8000/&lt;name&gt;, where &lt;name&gt; is any name, and the browser should display Hello &lt;name&gt;. \nVisit http://localhost:8000/&lt;image&gt; where  is the file name of the image in the static folder. The image should display in the browser, like so:\n\nConclusion\nOther things that could be implemented in the server are:\n\nStreams: Rocket can stream a response to the client (for things such as videos)\nSerializing responses into JSON and other types\nError handling, with custom responders for 400 and 500 status codes\nAnd much more...\n\nThank you for reading!\nSee more at the Official Rocket homepage\n\nAlways be rusty!\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/rocket-web-framework/","title":"Building a simple REST API with the Rocket Web Framework"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/traits-and-generics/":{"body":"Traits and Generics in Rust\nIntroduction\nMany languages, such as Java, C++, and Python have ways of abstracting types so that you can minimize the duplication of your code and make it easier to read. Traits and Generics in Rust allow you to achieve these goals. I will explain these concepts by showing code examples that are implemented with and without Generics and Traits, but achieve the same things.\n\n\nCreating struct instances without Generics\nIn the following code example, I will show how a struct can be created that holds a ZooAnimal. An enum for ZooAnimals has also been created in order to hold the different variants (types) of ZooAnimals:\nenum ZooAnimals{   //ZooAnimals enum that hold different varieties of animals.\n    Tigers,\n    Bears,\n    Lions,\n    Monkeys,\n    Fish\n}\n\nstruct ZooAnimal{        // This struct is the blueprint that holds one ZooAnimal variety.\n    species: ZooAnimals, // The 'species' attribute will only accept values that exist in the ZooAnimals enum.\n    weight: i32,         // The weight can be any i32 value.\n}\n\nNow, I can create an instance of a ZooAnimal like this:\nlet tigers = ZooAnimal{        // I create an instance of the ZooAnimal struct, and assign it to 'tigers'.\n  species: ZooAnimals::Tigers, // I use the 'ZooAnimals::Tigers' variant of the ZooAnimals enum to create the instance. \n  weight: 600,\n};\n\nThis code works fine if all you want to create are ZooAnimals, but what if you wanted to create an instance of ANY type of animal? The answer is to use Generics.\nCreating struct instances with Generics\nGenerics allow us to create data structures that can accept any type, or subset of a type. Any name can be used to represent a generic type, but the convention in Rust is to use the letter 'T' (meaning type) for any piece of code that accepts a single generic type. If there is more than one generic type needed, other single letters should be used. In a struct, the type parameter for the generic type must be declared in angle brackets after the name of the struct:\nstruct MyStruct&lt;T&gt;{\n}\n\nThen, inside the code block you can use the generic type anywhere you want. In a struct, you would use it to assign a value to an attribute:\nstruct MyBetterStruct&lt;T&gt;{\n    x: T                   // Whatever value is in 'T' will be assigned to x\n}\n\nNow that that is covered, we can convert our ZooAnimal struct into a struct that holds any type of animal:\nstruct AnimalGeneric&lt;T, U&gt;{  //Two generic parameters are used.\n    species: T,\n    weight: U,\n}\n\nThis struct holds any type of animal, which could be a String name, a different enum, or anything else! It could also accept any number value for the weight (i32, f32, f64, etc.).\nTraits\nTraits are a way to define a contract of behaviour for a struct without needing to provide an implementation. Following our zoo animal example, we can create a trait called Sound that defines the sound an animal will make when the method is called.\ntrait Sound{                    //Sound trait defined\n    fn make_sound(&amp;self){       //make_sound method defined with default behaviour.\n        println!(\"silence...\")\n    } \n}\n\nNow we have to implement the Sound trait on something... let's implement it on the AnimalGeneric struct. While we are at it, lets also add a third attribute to AnimalGeneric-- sound:\n\nimpl Sound for AnimalGeneric&lt;T, U, Y&gt;{     //The Sound trait has been implemented on the struct\n    fn make_sound(&amp;self) -&gt; String {\n        println!(\"The {} makes a sound of {}\", self.species, self.sound)  //The parameters of the AnimalGeneric instance will be passed into the method when it is created.\n    }\n}\n\nstruct AnimalGeneric&lt;T, U, Y&gt;{\n    species: T,\n    weight: U,\n    sound: Y    //'sound' attribute is added\n}\n\nAll that's left to do now is create an instance of the AnimalGeneric struct so that we can call the method on it:\nlet dog = AnimalGeneric{species: \"dog\", weight: 60, sound: \"bark\"};\ndog.make_sound(); //'bark' is printed to the screen!\n\nIf we call make_sound() on an instance of a generic giraffe with no sound supplied, the default implementation that we defined earlier on the trait is used:\nlet giraffe = AnimalGeneric{species: \"giraffe\", weight: 800, sound: ()}; \ngiraffe.make_sound(); //'silence...' is outputted, because giraffes are inaudible to humans.\n\nAnd then finally, creating an instance of one of the ZooAnimals with a sound supplied will work as expected:\nlet lion = ZooAnimal{species: ZooAnimals::Lions, weight: 500, sound: \"roar\"};\nlion.make_sound(); // 'roar' is outputted\nConclusion\nSo as you can see, using Traits and Generics in your code will make it a lot more flexible and should lead to less code duplication. They can also be used to program in an Object-Oriented style, to make the transition easier from languages such as Java.\nOne thing I want to mention is that you may have issues with printing to the screen depending on the Traits and Structs you are using. Please check here if you are having problems: display formatting\nThank you for reading!\n\nStay Rusty!\nSee more at the Official Rust documentation\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/traits-and-generics/","title":"Traits and Generics in Rust"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/":{"body":0,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/ownership-and-borrowing/":{"body":503,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/rocket-web-framework/":{"body":556,"title":7},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/traits-and-generics/":{"body":447,"title":3}},"length":4}};
