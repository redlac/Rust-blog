and Borrowing in Rust\nIntroduction\nRust is a very unique programming language. It gives you low-level control over your code and the ability to manage \nmemory without allocating it or de-allocating it with specific commands (although that is also possible with the \nunsafe\nkeyword. One of the ways that Rust can guarantee memory safety without a garbage collector is by implementing the \nconcepts of ownership and borrowing into the language.\n\n\nWhat is Ownership?\nOwnership is the way that Rust manages memory. It is a set of rules that the compiler says must be followed in for your \ncode to compile.\nThe very basic ownership rules in Rust are:\n\nEvery value is assigned to a variable, and that variable is the value's owner.\nEvery value can only have ONE owner at any given time.\nWhen the owner variable goes out of scope, a special function named drop is called it and its value is dropped.\n\nLets define a couple of those terms mentioned:\nscope refers to the lines in the program where a variable is valid.\ndrop is a function that Rust calls on variables allocated to the heap, that frees up memory for that variable when \nit goes out of scope. \nIn this very basic example, the variable dog_owner is the owner of the String \"dog\":\n{\n    let dog_owner = String::from(\"dog\"); //'let' is the keyword used to declare variables in Rust\n}\n\nWhen the program reached the }, the variable dog_owner goes out of scope and drop is called on it to free the memory \nit had allocated to it.\nIn the next example, the ownership of the String \"dog\" is moved from dog_owner to dog_trainer: \n{\n    let dog_owner = String::from(\"dog\"); //This line creates a String type from the string primitive \"dog\"\n    let dog_trainer = dog_owner;\n}\n\nAt this point, the variable dog_owner is no longer valid. We can verify this by trying to print out the value of \ndog_owner: \n{\n    let dog_owner = String::from(\"dog\");\n    let dog_trainer = dog_owner;\n    println!(\"{}\", dog_owner); //println!() is used to print values to the system output\n}\n\nIn other languages, you would expect that dog would be printed to the console, but in Rust this creates an error:\nerror[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `dog_owner`\n  --&gt; src\\main.rs:14:24\n   |\n12 |         let dog_owner = String::from(\"dog\");\n   |             --------- move occurs because `dog_owner` has type `std::string::String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait\n13 |         let dog_trainer = dog_owner;\n   |                           --------- value moved here\n14 |         println!(\"{}\", dog_owner); //println!() is used to print values to the system output\n   |                        ^^^^^^^^^ value borrowed here after move\n\nerror: aborting due to previous error\n\nIn the console, the error line value borrowed here after move means that we tried to borrow the variable \ndog_owner by passing it into the println!() macro, but it was already moved to dog_trainer so this is not allowed. \nBorrowing will be explained in the next section.\nWhat is Borrowing?\nTo start, let us define what references are: a reference is a variable that refers to another value, but does not \nhave ownership of it. When we pass a reference variable into a function, it is said that the function is borrowing \nthat variable.\nFor example, the function rent_movie() is borrowing a reference to the movie variable:\nfn main(){\n    let movie = String::from(\"Star Wars\");\n    rent_movie(&amp;movie);\n}\n\nfn rent_movie(movie: &amp;String) -&gt; &amp;String{ //Take a String reference as a parameter, and return a String reference\n    String::from(\"rented\") //The String \"rented\" is returned from the function. \n}\n\nSo far, so good. but what if we try to modify the movie in rent_movie()?\nfn main(){\n    let movie = String::from(\"Star Wars\");\n    rent_movie(&amp;movie);\n}\n\nfn rent_movie(movie: &amp;String) -&gt; &amp;String{ //Take a String reference as a parameter, and return a String reference\n    movie.push_str(\": Director's Cut\"); //attempting to create the String \"Star Wars: Director's Cut\"\n    String::from(\"rented\") //return \"rented\" \n}\n\nThis will not compile! As shown in the following error message, references are immutable in Rust:\nerror[E0596]: cannot borrow `*movie` as mutable, as it is behind a `&amp;` reference\n  --&gt; src\\main.rs:34:5\n   |\n33 | fn rent_movie(movie: &amp;String){\n   |                      ------- help: consider changing this to be a mutable reference: `&amp;mut std::string::String`\n34 |     movie.push_str(\": Director's Cut\"); //attempting to create the String \"Star Wars: Director's Cut\"\n   |     ^^^^^ `movie` is a `&amp;` reference, so the data it refers to cannot be borrowed as mutable\n\nerror: aborting due to previous error\n\nThis error illustrates something very important about Rust-- all variable are immutable by default! Typically, you would use a reference variable if you just wanted to read its value and not modify it.\nHowever, this error can be fixed by making movie mutable. That is, make it so that it's value can be modified. We can do this by adding the mut \nkeyword to the variable declaration and also make it so that rent_movie() accepts a mutable String as a parameter:\nfn main(){\n    let mut movie = String::from(\"Star Wars\");\n    rent_movie(&amp;mut movie);\n}\n\nfn rent_movie(movie: &amp;mut String) -&gt; &amp;mut String{ //Take a mutable String reference as a parameter, and return a mutable String reference\n    movie.push_str(\": Director's Cut\"); //attempting to create the String \"Star Wars: Director's Cut\"\n    movie //return the String \"Star Wars: Director's Cut\"\n}\nConclusion\nThe main takeaways from this post are: values can be assigned (moved) to different variables, but can only belong to ONE\nvariable at any given time. If you want to temporarily pass the value of a variable to a function, you can pass a reference \nto that variable to the function, and the function will borrow the variable and then give it back after the function \nreturns. There is a lot more to this topic, but I will leave it there for now!\n\nGet Rusty!\nSee more at the Official Rust documentation\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/ownership-and-borrowing/","title":"Ownership and Borrowing in Rust"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/":{"body":0,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/ownership-and-borrowing/":{"body":505,"title":3}},"length":2}};
